            <h2>About me ...</h2>

            <p> Hey there, thanks for checking out my page and wanting to get to know more about me.
                To start at the start, I'm a long-time web user, first time developer. My journey to web
                development is only just beginning, but I've been on the other side of technology with years
                of experience working with mobile phone providers and Internet Service Providers (ISPs)
                and engaging with customers.
            </p>
            <p>
                With such a rapidly changing world, I thought I better get ahead of the next employment wave
                and found my way to the Coding Bootcamp. It's only early days so things are a little sparse,
                but that will all be changing over the coming weeks and months. Don't forget to check back later
                for any updates.
            </p>
            <p>
                Outside of the Coding Bootcamp, I enjoy many sports, bike riding and martial arts. Along with a house
                full of pets that keep me busy.
            </p>
